# README

Codes to be used when I learn OSTEP. Some codes are copied from the book, some are written by me.

Homework directory is copied from [ostep-homework](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework), you can find the original homework there.

Each title of the homework may be different from the title of each chapter in the book. You can find the corresponding chapter in the book by looking at the README of homework directory and I will also write the corresponding chapter in file homework in each code directory.
